Preventing Runaway Cell Division,telomere maintenance; ATP binding; DNA repair,GO:0000723; GO:0005524; GO:0006281,BP; MF; BP,"Proteins that control the cell cycle, DNA repair and programmed cell death decide whether a cell divides or stops. Therapies target these checkpoints to block tumor growth or make cancer cells easier to eliminate.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0000723; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005524; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006281,https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0103; https://doi.org/10.1038/nrc.2017.58
Controlling Drug and Ion Flow (Transporters and Channels),RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity; DNA-templated transcription; host cell membrane,GO:0003968; GO:0006351; GO:0033644,MF; BP; CC,"Transporters and ion channels are the gates that move ions and drugs across membranes. Tuning these gates can control nerve activity and heart rhythm, and can also change how a drug is absorbed or cleared.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003968; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006351; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033644,https://doi.org/10.1038/nrd3028; https://doi.org/10.1101/cshperspect.a003947
Targeting Uncontrolled Cell Growth (Kinase Signaling),protein kinase activity; protein phosphorylation; membrane,GO:0004672; GO:0006468; GO:0016020,MF; BP; CC,"Kinases work like onâ€“off switches for growth and survival signals. When these switches get stuck on, cells may divide too much or ignore normal controls. Drugs that block selected kinases help slow tumors, reduce inflammation, and tune overactive pathways.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004672; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020,https://doi.org/10.1038/s41573-019-0054-1; https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1075762
