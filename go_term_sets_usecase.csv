Targeting Uncontrolled Cell Growth (Kinase Enzymes),Protein kinase activity; Kinase activity,GO:0004672; GO:0016301,MF; MF,"Kinases are proteins that attach phosphate groups to other molecules, acting like switches to turn cell processes on or off. This regulation affects growth, metabolism, and cell division. Because many diseases such as cancer involve overactive kinases, drugs often target these proteins to restore balance.",http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004672; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016301,Cohen P.

Regulating Hormone and Nerve Signals (GPCR Receptors),G protein-coupled receptor activity; G protein-coupled receptor signaling pathway,GO:0004930; GO:0007186,MF; BP,"GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) sit on the cell surface and detect signals like hormones, neurotransmitters, or smells. When activated, they trigger cascades inside the cell. This makes them essential for many senses and body processes, which is why more than a third of modern medicines act on GPCRs.",http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004930; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0007186,Hauser AS et al.

Controlling Drug and Ion Flow (Transporters & Channels),Transmembrane transporter activity; Ion channel activity,GO:0022857; GO:0005216,MF; MF,"Transporters and channels are like gates in the cell membrane that control the entry and exit of substances such as ions, nutrients, and drugs. They influence how cells communicate, get nutrients, and maintain electrical signals. Targeting these proteins can change how substances move in or out of cells, which is important in treating diseases like hypertension or epilepsy.",http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0022857; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005216,Giacomini KM et al.

Correcting Faulty Gene Activation (Transcription Factors),DNA-binding transcription factor activity; Regulation of transcription by RNA polymerase II,GO:0003700; GO:0006357,MF; BP,"Transcription factors are proteins that control when and how strongly genes are turned on or off. They shape how cells develop and respond to signals. Problems with transcription factors can lead to diseases like cancer or developmental disorders, so understanding them can help design therapies that influence gene activity.",http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003700; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006357,Lambert SA et al.

Managing Overactive Immune Responses (Cytokines & Receptors),Immune response; Cytokine activity; Receptor binding,GO:0006955; GO:0005125; GO:0005102,BP; MF; MF,"Proteins in the immune and inflammation response coordinate how the body defends itself against infections or injury. Cytokines and receptors help cells communicate during immune reactions. By targeting these proteins, drugs can boost immune responses, as in vaccines or cancer immunotherapy, or reduce harmful inflammation in autoimmune diseases.",http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006955; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005125; http://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005102,Dinarello CA.
