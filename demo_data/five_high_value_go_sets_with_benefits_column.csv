43,Preventing Runaway Cell Division,nucleus; DNA repair; chromatin organization,GO:0005634;GO:0006281;GO:0006325,CC; ?; ?,Cancer happens when cells divide when they should not. Proteins that control division and DNA repair can be targeted by medicines. Blocking these proteins can slow tumor growth or make other treatments work better.,"Why this is important: Tumors break the rules that tell cells when to divide or die. Blocking these control points can slow growth. What to look for: the tumor’s mutations, a plan to combine drugs to avoid resistance, and markers that show cells are dividing less.",Benefit of targeting these terms: A therapy that hits cell cycle or DNA repair can stop tumor cells from multiplying. It can also make chemotherapy and radiation work better. Biomarkers and imaging allow early proof that the treatment is on the right track.,https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006281; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006325,"Hanahan, D.

60,Managing Overactive Immune Responses (Cytokines & Receptors),RNA-directed RNA polymerase activity; DNA-templated transcription; host cell membrane,GO:0003968;GO:0006351;GO:0033644,MF; ?; CC,GPCRs are receptors on the outside of a cell. GPCR stands for G protein coupled receptor. They listen for signals like hormones or smells and then pass the message inside the cell. Many medicines work by turning these receptors up or down.,"Why this is important: GPCRs control everyday functions like heart rate and mood. They sit on the cell surface, which makes them easier for medicines to reach. What to look for: the natural signal that activates the receptor, the organs where it is found, and easy readouts such as changes in heart rate or blood pressure.","Benefit of targeting these terms: GPCRs sit on the cell surface and are easy to reach with pills or injections. Tuning these receptors can quickly improve symptoms like high blood pressure, anxiety, or asthma. Drugs can be designed to nudge the receptor gently, which helps reduce side effects while keeping benefit.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003968; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006351; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033644,"O’Shea, J.

76,Targeting Uncontrolled Cell Growth (Kinase signaling),protein kinase activity; protein phosphorylation; membrane,GO:0004672;GO:0006468;GO:0016020,MF; ?; CC,"Kinases are proteins that pass messages inside a cell. They can tell a cell to grow or to stop growing. When these messages stay on for too long, disease can happen. Medicines can block the overactive kinases to bring the messages back to normal.","Why this is important: Kinases act like on and off switches. In some cancers the switch is stuck on, so cells keep growing. A drug can fit into the switch and stop it. What to look for: which pathway the kinase is part of, known mutations that make it overactive, and simple lab tests that show the drug turns the signal down.","Benefit of targeting these terms: A well designed kinase drug can turn down the exact signal that is pushing cells to grow. For patients this can mean smaller tumors and fewer side effects than older chemotherapies. For developers there are clear lab tests to show the drug is working, such as a drop in phosphorylated proteins and shrinkage on scans.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004672; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020,"Fabbro, D., Cowan-Jacob, S.

86,Blocking Pathogen Survival Pathways,proteolysis; viral RNA genome replication,GO:0006508;GO:0039694,?; ?,Germs like bacteria and viruses use specific proteins to enter cells and make copies of themselves. Drugs that block these steps can stop the infection or make it milder.,"Why this is important: If you block the steps a germ needs to live, the illness gets shorter and milder. What to look for: how quickly the germ count drops in tests, how fast symptoms improve, and ways to prevent resistance by using drug pairs.","Benefit of targeting these terms: Hitting the steps a germ needs to survive shortens illness, lowers the chance of spreading, and reduces complications. Pairing drugs that hit different steps helps prevent resistance. Lab tests that count germs and track symptoms show benefit early in development.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006508; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0039694,"Laxminarayan, R., et al.

Mitochondria are parts of the cell that help make this energy. When these systems are out of tune, diseases like diabetes can develop. Targets in these pathways can be adjusted to improve energy use.","Why this is important: Good energy control supports every organ. Fixing faulty steps can lower blood sugar or improve fat levels. What to look for: which organ the target acts in, simple markers like glucose or cholesterol, and long term safety.","Benefit of targeting these terms: Correcting energy use can lower blood sugar, improve cholesterol, and raise stamina. These changes reduce the risk of heart disease and nerve damage in the long run. Simple tests like HbA1c and lipid panels track benefit during trials.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0008610; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0017000; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0031177,"Pagliarini, D.
