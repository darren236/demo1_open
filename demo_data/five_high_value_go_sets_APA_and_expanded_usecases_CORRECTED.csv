43,Preventing Runaway Cell Division,nucleus; DNA repair; chromatin organization,GO:0005634;GO:0006281;GO:0006325,CC; ?; ?,"Cancer is driven by failures in systems that control when a cell should divide, repair DNA, or self-destruct. Targets in cell cycle or DNA repair pathways can be inhibited to halt tumor growth or to make cancer cells more sensitive to other treatments. A practical way to review such a set is to map the terms to checkpoints like G1/S or to DNA repair pathways like homologous recombination.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0005634; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006281; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006325,"Hanahan, D.

Sometimes these messages become too strong and cause damage, as in autoimmune disease. Medicines can block a cytokine or its receptor to reduce symptoms and protect tissues. To evaluate a cytokine set, look at which cells produce the cytokine, the diseases where it is elevated, and whether blocking it has proven benefits in clinical studies.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0003968; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006351; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0033644,"O’Shea, J.

76,Targeting Uncontrolled Cell Growth (Kinase signaling),protein kinase activity; protein phosphorylation; membrane,GO:0004672;GO:0006468;GO:0016020,MF; ?; CC,"Kinases act like switches that pass messages inside cells. They control growth, division, and survival. If a kinase stays on when it should turn off, cells can grow too fast. This is common in some cancers. Medicines called kinase inhibitors are designed to fit into the kinase and stop its action. In practice, doctors use them to slow tumor growth and to reduce harmful signaling in certain inflammatory diseases. When evaluating a kinase set, users often look for: the pathway it belongs to, tissues where it is active, and known drugs that already target it.",https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0004672; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0006468; https://amigo.geneontology.org/amigo/term/GO:0016020,"Fabbro, D., Cowan-Jacob, S.

When these pathways are out of tune, energy supply fails and disease follows, such as diabetes or fatty-liver disease. Targets in these pathways can be adjusted to restore healthier energy use.
